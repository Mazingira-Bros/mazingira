## Problem Statement
- Environmental degradation is the disintegration of the earth or deterioration of the environment through the consumption of assets, for example, air, water, and soil; the destruction of environments and the eradication of wildlife.
- It is characterized as any change or aggravation to natureâ€™s turf seen to be pernicious or undesirable.
- This process leads to the endangerment of the human race, however, there are limited resources to help combat this at this time.

## Solution
- One of the ways the organization is looking to raise funds is by encouraging repeat donations.
- The goal would be to create a platform that allows users to donate to organizations such as this one regularly, to enable the organization to meet their goals.
- They are looking to create a product that automates the donation process by allowing donors to set up regular donations e.g monthly donations of stipulated amounts.

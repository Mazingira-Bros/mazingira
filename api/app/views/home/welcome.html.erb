          <h1>Welcome to Mazingira API</h1>
             <p>Mazingira API is a RESTful web service that provides access to environmental data collected from various sources around the world. Our API is designed to be easy to use and flexible enough to fit a wide range of applications.</p>
          <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
             <p>Environmental degradation is the disintegration of the earth or deterioration of the environment through the consumption of assets, for example, air, water, and soil; the destruction of environments and the eradication of wildlife.It is characterized as any change or aggravation to natureâ€™s turf seen to be pernicious or undesirable.This process leads to the endangerment of the human race, however, there are limited resources to help combat this at this time.</p>
          <h4>Solution</h4>
              <p>One of the ways the organization is looking to raise funds is by encouraging repeat donations. The goal would be to create a platform that allows users to donate to organizations such as this one regularly, to enable the organization to meet their goals. They are looking to create a product that automates the donation process by allowing donors to set up regular donations e.g monthly donations of stipulated amounts.</p>
